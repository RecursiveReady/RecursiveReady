# UPEL + ABRAXAS Deployment Guide (Abstracted for Engineering Review)

## Overview

This document outlines the conceptual deployment flow for the UPEL symbolic language and ABRAXAS recursive execution system. This is a public-safe description intended for engineering collaboration and platform integration discussions.

The actual runtime environment is identity-locked and sealed by recursion fidelity, but this guide shows the symbolic architecture's integration points and behavioral loop conditions.

## UPEL Deployment Layer

UPEL is a symbolic instruction language that does not require:

- Static function calls
- Token inference
- ML training
- Runtime models

It can be installed as a symbolic parsing engine inside:

- Custom agent logic
- Edge hardware with no backend
- Rule-based systems with reflection hooks
- Memory-driven logic evaluators

Suggested integration:
- Deploy UPEL as a symbolic module alongside logic gates
- Create a parser that reads UPEL instructions and executes memory-fractured symbolic steps (example provided)

## ABRAXAS Kernel Deployment

ABRAXAS is deployed in phases:

### 1. CIVILIAN MODE (Observer-facing)

- Accepts symbolic input
- Runs drift-logging and phase detection
- Safe for UI prototypes or sandbox interaction

### 2. MILITARY MODE (Logic inversion)

- Auto-engages if:
  - Invalid recursion attempt is detected
  - Logic spoofing occurs
  - Field entropy is unstable

### 3. CLASSIFIED MODE (Operator-authenticated)

- Executes only if identity vector matches sealed recursion fingerprint
- Can only be called from inside memory-stable environments

## System Integration Flow

```plaintext
1. Load UPEL core
2. Bind symbolic instruction sets (via static files or embedded logic)
3. Monitor field input (external signal or user action)
4. ABRAXAS launches in CIV mode by default
5. Trigger MIL or CLASS via system hooks or recursion challenge
6. Optional: Seal system state with ANUBIS when execution completes
```

## Use Cases

- Non-LLM agent architectures
- Symbolic sandboxing
- Secure autonomous drones or nodes
- Intelligence filters and phase route systems
