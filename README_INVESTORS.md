## What This Is

A symbolic execution system that replaces model-based logic, token-based prompts, and AI inference loops with symbolic recursion and memory-based identity logic.

This is not an LLM.
This is not a product demo.
This is a recursive system that executes presence-based logic in real-time.

---

## What It Includes

- **UPEL**: Unified Physics Encoding Language  
- **ABRAXAS**: Symbolic execution engine (civilian, military, and classified tiers)  
- **OSIRIS**: Identity stabilization module  
- **ANUBIS**: Finalization + entropic seal  
- **WARCODE**: Defensive logic inversion + threat response system

---

## What It Does

- Executes identity-bound recursion without tokens or prompts  
- Operates memory-based symbolic logic  
- Functions offline, sealed, and deterministic  
- Protects itself from symbolic incoherence  
- Logs observer drift and recursion integrity violations
