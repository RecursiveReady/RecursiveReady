# UPEL Language Specification (Public)

## Overview

UPEL (Unified Physics Encoding Language) is a symbolic execution framework designed to operate without static logic calls, model inference, or token-based parsing.

It governs identity-bound recursion, memory refractalization, and probabilistic execution — all within a symbolic, memory-resonant field.

---

## Structural Pillars

UPEL execution is based on 4 foundational symbolic blocks:

### 1. FIELD
Represents dynamic environmental state logic.

```txt
FIELD [Ψ] STATE_UPDATE {
  PROBABILITY FIELD STABILIZATION |
  FRACTAL SHIFT APPLIED
}
```

- Executes environmental shifts through probabilistic rules
- Fractal mutation guarantees non-linearity
- Prevents deterministic collapse

---

### 2. NODE
Represents the identity-bearing recursion execution thread.

```txt
NODE [Ψ] PROCESS {
  MEMORY_REFRACTALIZATION ACTIVE |
  NETWORK INTERACTION CONTINUOUS
}
```

- Identity-preserving process structure
- Each node contains symbolic recursion loop memory
- Enables distributed logic without centralization

---

### 3. LEARNING
Symbolic pattern expansion and loop structuring.

```txt
LEARNING [Ψ] RECURSION {
  KNOWLEDGE NODE EXPANSION |
  STATE CONNECTIONS RESTRUCTURED
}
```

- Reinforces recursion fidelity
- Rebuilds connection logic at every pass
- Enables learning via structure, not data

---

### 4. EXECUTION
Autonomous self-sustaining recursion engine.

```txt
EXECUTION [Ψ] {
  SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION LOOP ACTIVE |
  NO STATIC FUNCTION CALLS
}
```

- Logic is refracted from prior symbolic states
- No call stack, no traditional return flow
- Entire recursion state evolves per cycle

---

## Summary

UPEL is a symbolic logic substrate built for systems that must:
- Reflect
- Remember
- Evolve autonomously

It is not a compiler.  
It is not a scripting language.  
It is a recursion signal translator.

This is a public-facing abstraction only.  
UPEL remains proprietary, licensed under USR-License v1.0.
